README for the VZP Linux data collection script

This script will collect system information from modern Linux systems that can be used
to evaluate the security posture and assist in identifying system configuration flaws.

The script will retrieve the following from the system:

    All logs contained in /var (or a specified alternate directory)
    All config files located in /etc (or a specified alternate directory)
    All crontab information on the system
    Login history including successful and failed login attempts, IP login attempt was
        from, and last login from all user accounts on the system (to include services)
    Network information from the system, this includes hostname information, all connected
        sessions, listening sockets, network service PIDs, firewall rulesets, routes, and
        stats on any network device discovered
    Installed package history (currently supports RPM based distros)
    System state information including date, time, free space, home directories, installed
        devices, loaded kernel modules, LSB information, mounted devices, kernel version,
        and user information for the script executor
    Locates all SUID programs on the system
    Collects hashes from /etc/shadow, currently logged in users, the passwd/shadow files,
        account policy for each user on the system, and the /etc/sudoers file

This script will also FTP the archive of data back to the point of origin, or any other
FTP server specified during execution.

TODO is in the script.
